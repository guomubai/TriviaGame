# TriviaGame

This is a trivia game that I put together for our assignment. 

The goal of the game is to answer all the trivia questions before the timer goes down to 0. At the end, the screen will show the total of correct, incorrect, and unaswered questions. 

There is an old school style video game theme that I used from http://jsfiddle.net/fleb/wnnkL0p5/. I modified it to make it a little more "video game" like. 

THe javascript was compiled after watching a lot of youtube tutorials on doing trivia games with JS :)

* Current bug that I am working on: I am having trouble getting the correct answers to total up. I think it has to do with my $.each lines, but I am not sure.
